Our goal is to ensure Qubes OS meets the needs of the community by gathering responses to common questions about what the community seeks from Qubes OS. Surveys are 100% anonymous (no IP or timestamp information collected) and hosted on a server we own and operate. 5-10 minutes is all it should take.
