Dear Qubes Community,

When we reflect on how the Qubes userbase has [grown][statistics] over
the past few years, we are humbled by the number of people who have
chosen to join us in entrusting the security of their digital lives to
Qubes. We recognize the immense responsibility this places on us. This
sense of duty is what drives our work to make Qubes as secure as it can
be.

We are further humbled by the many generous donations that have been
made this year. Qubes is protecting real people around the world in ever
greater numbers, and many of you have shown your appreciation by giving
back to the project.  We are truly grateful for your support. Thank you.

Top Donors of 2017
------------------
We'd like to take this opportunity to thank the top donors of 2017 (so
far!):

 - 50,000 EUR from the VPN service **[Mullvad]**!
 - 10 BTC from an anonymous donor!
 - 10,000 USD from **zby**, angel investor!
 - 1,000 USD recurring annual donation from **Eric Grosse**!

Thank you to these donors and to everyone who has donated to the [Qubes
Decentralized Bitcoin Fund][BTC] and the [Qubes Open Collective][OC]!
Your donations continue to fund work on Qubes OS. Thanks to your
support, we've just [released Qubes 4.0-rc1][4.0-rc1], and we're getting
ever closer to a stable release!

Our Work Continues
------------------
Today, Qubes safeguards tens of thousands of users around the globe in
their work and personal lives, including every member of the Qubes Team.
But the path here has been a long and difficult one, in terms of both
the great dedication required of the team and the monetary costs that
Invisible Things Lab has borne, and continues to bear, so that the
project could continue throughout the years.

Without a doubt, it's all been worth it. Qubes is our passion. It's part
of our lives. We're gratified and exhilarated to see Qubes bringing real
value to people around the world, and we're more determined than ever to
make Qubes the best free and open-source secure operating system it can
be -- for everyone. We know that many of you feel the same way we do.
If Qubes is important to you, please consider [joining us in supporting
its ongoing development][donations]. Everyone's support is valuable to
us, no matter how large or how small. Together, we can ensure that Qubes
is around to protect us all for a long time to come.

Sincerely,  
The Qubes OS Team
