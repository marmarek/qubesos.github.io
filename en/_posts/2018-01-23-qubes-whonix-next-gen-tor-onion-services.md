The Qubes and Whonix projects now have [next-generation Tor onion
services][tor-v3] (a.k.a. "v3 onion services"), which provide [several
security improvements][tor-wiki] over v2 onion services:

**Qubes:** <http://sik5nlgfc5qylnnsr57qrbm64zbdx6t4lreyhpon3ychmxmiem7tioad.onion>  
**Whonix:** <http://dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion>

These services run alongside our existing ("v2") onion services:

**Qubes:** <http://qubesos4rrrrz6n4.onion>  
**Whonix:** <http://kkkkkkkkkk63ava6.onion>

For instructions on accessing the new addresses and further details,
please see the [Whonix announcement]. Our sincere thanks go to the
Whonix team, and especially **fortasse**, the Whonix server
administrator, for doing this.
