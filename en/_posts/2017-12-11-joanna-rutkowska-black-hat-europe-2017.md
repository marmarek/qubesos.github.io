### Abstract of "Security through Distrusting" ###
> There are different approaches to making (computer) systems (reasonably) secure and trustworthy:
> 
> At one extreme, we would like to ensure everything (software, hardware, infrastructure) is _trusted_.
> This means the code has no bugs or backdoors, patches are always available and deployed, admins always competent and trustworthy, and the infrastructure always reliable...
> 
> On the other end of the spectrum, however, we would like to _distrust_ (nearly) all components and actors, and have no single almighty element in the system.
> 
> In my opinion, the industry has been way too much focused on this first approach, which I see as overly naive and non-scalable to more complex systems.
>
> In this talk, based on my prior work as both offensive researcher in the past, as well as an engineer and architect on the defense side in the recent years, I will attempt to convince the audience that moving somehow towards the "security through distrusting" principle might be a good idea.
> Equally important though, the talk will discuss the trade-offs that this move requires and where can we find the sweet spot between the two approaches.
