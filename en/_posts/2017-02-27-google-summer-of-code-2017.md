We're pleased to announce that the Qubes OS Project has been accepted as a mentor organization for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2017!
Many interesting projects have already been proposed, and we're still looking for both students and mentors.
If you're interested in participating, please see our [GSoC 2017 page](/gsoc/) for details!
