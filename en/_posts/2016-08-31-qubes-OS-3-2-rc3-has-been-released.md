Today we're releasing the third release candidate for Qubes 3.2, which includes
some final bug fixes over the [previous release candidate][qubes-32-rc2-announced].
We believe this will be the last release candidate, which will become the final
3.2 release in coming weeks. 

For more details about new features introduced in Qubes 3.2 in general, read
the [release notes][release-notes]. The installation image can be downloaded
from [here][download].

Thank you to all the users testing release candidates and submitting bug
reports! Your feedback helps us to make the final release as stable as possible.
