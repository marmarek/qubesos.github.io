Reporting Security Issues in Qubes OS
-------------------------------------

If you believe you have found a security issue affecting Qubes OS, either directly or indirectly (e.g. the issue affects Xen in a configuration that is used in Qubes OS), then we would be more than happy to hear from you!
We promise to treat any reported issue seriously and, if the investigation confirms that it affects Qubes, to patch it within a reasonable time and release a public [Qubes Security Bulletin][Security Bulletins] that describes the issue, discusses the potential impact of the vulnerability, references applicable patches or workarounds, and credits the discoverer.


The Qubes Security Team
-----------------------

The Qubes Security Team (QST) is the subset of the [Qubes Team] that is responsible for ensuring the security of Qubes OS and the Qubes OS Project.
In particular, the QST is responsible for:

 - Responding to [reported security issues]
 - Evaluating whether [XSAs][Xen Security Advisory (XSA) Tracker] affect the security of Qubes OS
 - Writing, applying, and/or distributing security patches to fix vulnerabilities in Qubes OS
 - Writing, signing, and publishing [Security Bulletins]
 - Writing, signing, and publishing [Canaries]
 - Generating, safeguarding, and using the project's [PGP Keys]

As a security-oriented operating system, the QST is fundamentally important to Qubes, and every Qubes user implicitly trusts the members of the QST by virtue of the actions listed above.
The Qubes Security Team can be contacted via email at the following address:
