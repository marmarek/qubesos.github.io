Qubes OS Project Funding
========================

Qubes OS is [free and open-source software][FOSS] (read about the [license]).
This means that Qubes OS is not a paid or proprietary product. We do not earn
any revenue by selling it. Instead, we rely external sources of funding from
individuals and organizations who find the work we do valuable and who in turn
rely on Qubes OS for secure computing in their work and personal lives. (Read
more about our [partners].)

We plan to fund continued Qubes OS development through a diverse mix of sources,
both in terms of the entities providing the funding and the timelines of the
funding. 

We are seeking new sources of funding and welcome your help in these endeavors. 
If you or your organization has relevant knowledge, experience, leads, or 
resources and would like to help us secure the future of Qubes OS, please 
contact [Michael Carbone].
