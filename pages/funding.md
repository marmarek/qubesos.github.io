Qubes OS Project Funding
========================

Qubes OS is [free open-source software][FOSS] (read about the [license]). This
means that Qubes OS is not a paid or proprietary product. We do not earn any
revenue by selling it. Instead, we rely external sources of funding from
individuals and organizations who find the work we do valuable and who in turn
rely on Qubes OS for secure computing in their work and personal lives.

Current and Past Funding Sources
--------------------------------

The Qubes OS Project currently receives (or has received) funding from the
following sources:

 * [Bitcoin donations][donate]
 * [The Open Technology Fund (OTF)][OTF] (read the [announcement])

Future Funding Sources
----------------------

We plan to fund continued Qubes OS development through a diverse mix of sources,
both in terms of the entities providing the funding and the timelines of the
funding. We are currently seeking new sources of funding. We also welcome your
help in these endeavors. If you or your organization has relevant knowledge,
experience, leads, or resources and would like to help us secure the future of
Qubes OS, please contact `michael at qubes-os dot org`.
