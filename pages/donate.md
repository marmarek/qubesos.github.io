## ![btc](/attachment/site/btc.png) Donate Bitcoin

Thanks for your interest in supporting Qubes! The Qubes project currently accepts money donations in Bitcoins. If you are interested instead in donating hardware or providing substantial and sustained [funding](/funding/), please visit the [Qubes Partners page](/partners/) and send us an email.

#### Send Bitcoins to:

<form class="more-bottom">
  <div class="form-group">
  <div class="input-group input-group-lg">
    <span class="input-group-addon" id="donate-btn-icon"><i class="fa fa-btc"></i></span>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" aria-describedby="donate-btc-icon" value="3GakuQQDUGyyUnV1p5Jc3zd6CpQDkDwmDq" readonly>
  </div>
  </div>
</form>

#### Verification of Bitcoin address

The donation address can be verified via the [Qubes Security Pack]
(QSP or `qubes-secpack`), specficially in the [fund] directory. Detailed
instructions for verifying the digital signatures are available [here][verify].

You can also view the address on [blockexplorer.com] and [blockchain.info].
