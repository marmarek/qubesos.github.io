## ![btc](/attachment/site/btc.png) Donate Bitcoin

Thanks for your interest in supporting Qubes! The Qubes project currently accepts money donations in Bitcoins. If you are interested instead in donating hardware or providing substantial and sustained [funding](/funding/), please visit the [Qubes Partners page](/partners/) and send us an email.

#### Send Bitcoins to:

<form class="more-bottom">
  <div class="form-group">
  <div class="input-group input-group-lg">
    <span class="input-group-addon" id="donate-btn-icon"><i class="fa fa-btc"></i></span>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" aria-describedby="donate-btc-icon" value="14zockMSKKp5MK6X2cHJ3mQwm9MwYsJ39j" readonly>
  </div>
  </div>
</form>

#### Or scan this QR code:

![Bitcoin QR Code](/attachment/site/btc-qr.png)

#### Verification of Bitcoin address

This address can also be found in a message posted to Qubes mailing list, which can be viewed via Google Groups Web interface over SSL [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/qubes-devel/u3wAzm1dB5Y/s5CiUGDebL4J), for double verification. For additional verification, you can verify the digital signature on the message, which should come from Joanna Rutkowska.

You can check how much others have donated already (over the entire time) via [blockexplorer](https://blockexplorer.com/address/14zockMSKKp5MK6X2cHJ3mQwm9MwYsJ39j) and [blockchain](https://blockchain.info/address/14zockMSKKp5MK6X2cHJ3mQwm9MwYsJ39j).
