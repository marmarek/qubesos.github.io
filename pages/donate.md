[Donate using Bitcoin](#bitcoin) [Donate using Credit Card](#credit-card)

Thanks for your interest in supporting Qubes! The Qubes Project accepts monetary donations in [Bitcoins](#bitcoin) (preferred) or [credit card](#credit-card). If you are interested instead in donating hardware or providing substantial and sustained [funding], please visit the [Qubes Partners page] and send us an email.

## ![btc](/attachment/site/btc.png) <a name="bitcoin">Donate Bitcoin</a>

Bitcoin donations have zero administrative overhead for us, which means 100% of your donation goes towards supporting Qubes development!

#### Donation Address:

<form class="more-bottom">
  <div class="form-group">
  <div class="input-group input-group-lg">
    <span class="input-group-addon" id="donate-btn-icon"><i class="fa fa-btc"></i></span>
    <input type="text" class="form-control" aria-describedby="donate-btc-icon" value="3GakuQQDUGyyUnV1p5Jc3zd6CpQDkDwmDq" readonly>
  </div>
  </div>
</form>

#### About the Donation Fund

The Qubes Project maintains a decentralized Bitcoin fund using a
multi-signature wallet. This means that no single person is capable of spending
these funds. For further details, please see [here][announcement].

#### How to Verify the Address

The donation address can be verified via the [Qubes Security Pack]
(QSP or `qubes-secpack`), specifically in the [fund] directory. Detailed
instructions for verifying the digital signatures are available [here][verify].

You can also view the address on [blockexplorer.com] and [blockchain.info].

## Donate Using <a name="credit-card">Credit Card</a>

You can donate towards Qubes development using your credit card through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/qubes-os). Unlike donating with Bitcoin, we lose [~14%](https://opencollective.com/faq) of your donation to administrative overhead.
