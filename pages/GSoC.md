2017 Google Summer of Code
================

## Information for Students

Thank you for your interest in participating in the [Google Summer of Code program][gsoc] with the [Qubes OS team][team]. You can read more about the Google Summer of Code program at the [official website][gsoc] and the [official FAQ][gsoc-faq].

Being accepted as a Google Summer of Code student is quite competitive. Students wishing to participate in the Summer of Code must be aware that you will be required to produce code for Qubes OS in 3 months. Your mentors, Qubes developers, will dedicate a portion of their time towards mentoring you. Therefore, we seek candidates who are committed to helping Qubes long-term and are willing to do quality work and be proactive in communicating with your mentor.

You don't have to be a proven developer -- in fact, this whole program is meant to facilitate joining Qubes and other free and open source communities. The Qubes community maintains information about [contributing to Qubes development][contributing] and [how to send patches][patches]. In order to contribute code to the Qubes project, you must be able to [sign your code][code-signing].

You should start learning the components that you plan on working on before the start date. Qubes developers are available on the [mailing lists][ml-devel] for help. The GSoC timeline reserves a lot of time for bonding with the project -- use that time wisely. Good communication is key, you should plan to communicate with your team daily and formally report progress and plans weekly. Students who neglect active communication will be failed.

### Overview of Steps

- [ ] Join the [qubes-devel list][ml-devel] and introduce yourself, and meet your fellow developers
- [ ] Read [Google's instructions for participating][gsoc-participate] and the [GSoC Student Manual][gsoc-student]
- [ ] Take a look at the list of ideas below
- [ ] Come up with project that you are interested in
- [ ] Read the Student Proposal guidelines below
- [ ] Write a first draft proposal and send it to the qubes-devel mailing list for review
- [ ] Submit proposal using [Google's web interface][gsoc-submit] ahead of the deadline (this requires a Google Account!)
- [ ] Submit proof of enrollment well ahead of the deadline

Coming up with an interesting idea that you can realistically achieve in the time available to you (one summer) is probably the most difficult part. We strongly recommend getting involved in advance of the beginning of GSoC, and we will look favorably on applications from students who have already started to act like free and open source developers.

### Student proposal guidelines

A project proposal is what you will be judged upon. Write a clear proposal on what you plan to do, the scope of your project, and why we should choose you to do it. Proposals are the basis of the GSoC projects and therefore one of the most important things to do well. The proposal is not only the basis of our decision of which student to choose, it has also an effect on Google's decision as to how many student slots are assigned to Qubes. 

Below is the application template:

```
# Introduction

Every software project should solve a problem. Before offering the solution (your Google Summer of Code project), you should first define the problem. What’s the current state of things? What’s the issue you wish to solve and why? Then you should conclude with a sentence or two about your solution. Include links to discussions, features, or bugs that describe the problem further if necessary.

# Project goals

Be short and to the point, and perhaps format it as a list. Propose a clear list of deliverables, explaining exactly what you promise to do and what you do not plan to do. “Future developments” can be mentioned, but your promise for the Google Summer of Code term is what counts.

# Implementation

Be detailed. Describe what you plan to do as a solution for the problem you defined above. Include technical details, showing that you understand the technology. Illustrate key technical elements of your proposed solution in reasonable detail.

# Timeline

Show that you understand the problem, have a solution, have also broken it down into manageable parts, and that you have a realistic plan on how to accomplish your goal. Here you set expectations, so don’t make promises you can’t keep. A modest, realistic and detailed timeline is better than promising the impossible.

If you have other commitments during GSoC, such as a job, vacation, exams, internship, seminars, or papers to write, disclose them here. GSoC should be treated like a full-time job, and we will expect approximately 40 hours of work per week. If you have conflicts, explain how you will work around them. If you are found to have conflicts which you did not disclose, you may be failed.

Open and clear communication is of utmost importance. Include your plans for communication in your proposal; daily if possible. You will need to initiate weekly formal communications such as a detailed email to the qubes-devel mailing list. Lack of communication will result in you being failed.

# About me

Provide your contact information and write a few sentences about you and why you think you are the best for this job. Prior contributions to Qubes are helpful; list your commits. Name people (other developers, students, professors) who can act as a reference for you. Mention your field of study if necessary. Now is the time to join the relevant mailing lists. We want you to be a part of our community, not just contribute your code.

Tell us if you are submitting proposals to other organizations, and whether or not you would choose Qubes if given the choice.

Other things to think about:
* Are you comfortable working independently under a supervisor or mentor who is several thousand miles away, and perhaps 12 time zones away? How will you work with your mentor to track your work? Have you worked in this style before?
* If your native language is not English, are you comfortable working closely with a supervisor whose native language is English? What is your native language, as that may help us find a mentor who has the same native language?
* After you have written your proposal, you should get it reviewed. Do not rely on the Qubes mentors to do it for you via the web interface, although we will try to comment on every proposal. It is wise to ask a colleague or a developer to critique your proposal. Clarity and completeness are important.
```

## Project Ideas
