The Qubes Security Team is currently investigating the extent to which
[XSA-254] (and the [Meltdown] and [Spectre] attacks more generally)
affect the security of Qubes OS. The practical impact of these attacks
on Qubes is currently unclear.  While the Qubes Security Team is a
member of the [Xen predisclosure list], [XSA-254] was disclosed on an
accelerated timetable ahead of schedule, so our team has not yet had a
chance to analyze these attacks, nor has the Xen Project released any
patches associated with [XSA-254]. We are continuing to monitor the
situation closely. Once the Security Team makes a determination about
the impact on Qubes, we will make another announcement, update the
[XSA Tracker], and, if appropriate, issue a [Qubes Security Bulletin]
with information about patching.
