We're pleased to announce the release of Qubes 4.0.1! This is the first
stable point release of Qubes 4.0. It includes many updates over the
initial 4.0 release, in particular:

 - All 4.0 dom0 updates to date, including a lot of bug fixes and
   improvements for GUI tools
 - Fedora 29 TemplateVM
 - Debian 9 TemplateVM
 - Whonix 14 Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs
 - Linux kernel 4.14

Qubes 4.0.1 is available on the [Downloads] page.


What is a point release?
------------------------

A point release does not designate a separate, new version of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 4.0) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 4.0 and fully updating it results in the same system as installing
Qubes 4.0.1.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you're currently using an up-to-date Qubes 4.0 installation
(including updated Fedora 29, Debian 9, and Whonix 14 templates), then
your system is already equivalent to a Qubes 4.0.1 installation. No
action is needed.

Similarly, if you're currently using a Qubes 4.0.1 release candidate
(4.0.1-rc1 or 4.0.1-rc2), and you've followed the standard procedure for
keeping it up-to-date, then your system is equivalent to a 4.0.1 stable
installation, and no additional action is needed.

If you're currently using Qubes 4.0 but don't have these new templates
installed yet, we recommend that you follow the appropriate
documentation to do so:

 - [Fedora 29]
 - [Debian 9]
 - [Whonix 14]

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 4.0 for any reason, then the 4.0.1 ISO will make this more
convenient and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 4.0 updates to date.
It will be especially helpful for users whose hardware is too new to be
compatible with the original Qubes 4.0 installer.
