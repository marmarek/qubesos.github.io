Today the Qubes team is pleased to announce a partnership with the
laptop maker [Purism](https://puri.sm) and the launch of the
Qubes-certification program.

In our work on Qubes OS, we have focused on creating a reasonably secure
operating system. A common barrier of entry to Qubes for new users is
uncertainty whether their hardware can take advantage of all of Qubes'
security features.

With the [Qubes-certification program](/doc/certified-hardware/#qubes-certified-laptops), we will
partner with a few select computer makers to ensure that Qubes is
compatible with them, so that new users have clear path towards getting
started with Qubes if they desire. We aim for these makers to be as
diverse as possible in terms of geography, cost, and availability.

As part of this partnership, the Qubes team will certify Purism's
Librem laptops to ensure that they are compatible with Qubes.

This begins with the certification of the
[Librem 13](https://puri.sm/librem-13/). For existing Librem 13 users, we have
[provided instructions](/doc/certified-hardware/) on improving Qubes
compatibility with the Librem 13. For users now who seek to buy a
Librem 13, there will be an option  to have Qubes pre-installed on
their Librem 13. This will include all the necessary tweaks for maximum
compatibility with Qubes.

In addition, the Qubes team will receive a small portion of the revenue
from any Librem 13 sale that come with Qubes pre-installed.

Both organizations are interested in stable, long term support for
Qubes+Purism laptops. Going into the future, we plan with Purism to
improve the functionality and security of Purism laptops to ensure that
Qubes users can have the best of freedom, security, and privacy in one
convenient package.
