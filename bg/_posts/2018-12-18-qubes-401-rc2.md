We're pleased to announce the second release candidate for Qubes 4.0.1!
Features:

- Fixes for bugs discovered in 4.0.1-rc1
- All 4.0 dom0 updates to date
- Fedora 29 TemplateVM
- Debian 9 TemplateVM
- Whonix 14 Gateway and Workstation TemplateVMs
- Linux kernel 4.14

Qubes 4.0.1-rc2 is available on the [Downloads] page.


What is a point release?
------------------------

A point release does not designate a separate, new version of Qubes OS.
Rather, it designates its respective major or minor release (in this
case, 4.0) inclusive of all updates up to a certain point. Installing
Qubes 4.0 and fully updating it results in the same system as installing
Qubes 4.0.1.


What should I do?
-----------------

If you're currently using an up-to-date Qubes 4.0 installation, then
your system is already equivalent to a Qubes 4.0.1 installation. No
action is needed.

Regardless of your current OS, if you wish to install (or reinstall)
Qubes 4.0 for any reason, then the 4.0.1 ISO will make this more
convenient and secure, since it bundles all Qubes 4.0 updates to date.
It will be especially helpful for users whose hardware is too new to be
compatible with the original Qubes 4.0 installer.


Release planning
----------------

Since the most severe bugs related to Fedora 29 have been addressed, we
expect that this will be the final release candidate for 4.0.1. As
usual, you can help by [reporting any bugs you
encounter][reporting-bugs]. If no major problems are discovered in this
release candidate, 4.0.1 should follow in approximately three weeks.
