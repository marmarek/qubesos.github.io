Today we're releasing the second release candidate for Qubes 3.2, which includes
many bug fixes over the [previous release candidate][qubes-32-rc1-announced].
All critical bugs we know of are fixed, including XSA 182, which was recently
announced in [Qubes Security Bulletin #24][qsb-24]. However, there are still
some non-critical bugs to iron out prior to final release of 3.2.

Beginning with this release, we've officially switched from KDE to Xfce4, which
is now the new default desktop environment in dom0. Read the
[release notes][release-notes] for more details, installation and update
instructions. The installation image can be downloaded from [here][download].

Thank you to all the users testing release candidates and submitting bug
reports! Your feedback helps us to make the final release as stable as possible.
