The Xen Project has published Xen Security Advisory 289 (XSA-289).
This XSA does **not** affect the security of Qubes OS, and no user
action is necessary.

XSA-289 is unusual in that it does not disclose any new
vulnerabilities. Rather, it is only for the purpose of providing
information about previously-disclosed vulnerabilities. These
vulnerabilities were all patched in Qubes OS as part of [QSB #43],
which we published on 2018-09-02. Therefore, XSA-289 does not affect
the security of updated Qubes OS installations.


This XSA has been added to the [XSA Tracker]:
